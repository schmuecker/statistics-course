## Objective

In this exercise, we're trying to use our statistics skills to analyze data about the start-up ecosystem. The dataset includes information about start-up organizations, people, investments, acquisitions and more.

You can find the dataset on the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/startup-investments). It originates from the Crunchbase 2013 snapshot. More recent data can be found on the [üåç Crunchbase Data website](https://data.crunchbase.com/docs).

## Setup

Make sure to have Python 3+ installed on your machine.

This project uses IPython Jypeter notebooks, which are quite common in data analysis. If you haven't heard of them, make sure to get the general idea of notebooks [here](https://fileinfo.com/extension/ipynb).

It is recommended to open the notebooks with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). Alternatively, you can upload notebooks to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) to work with them in the browser.

## Getting started

**01 ‚Äì Downloading the Dataset**

To download the dataset, you have to obtain a Kaggle API key. For more details, follow the instructions in `load_dataset.ipynb`.

The dataset will be saved in the `startup-investments/` directory.

**02 ‚Äì Running the Analysis**

You can run the `explore_objects.ipynb` notebook to find a general analysis of the organizations dataset.

To go into further details about investments, run the `fundings_analysis.ipynb` notebook.

**03 ‚Äì Viewing the Geographical Analysis**

We've prepared a geographical analysis for start-ups of different industries. Run the `heat_map.ipynb` notebook to get some insights.

After running the notebook, you can find even more plots in the `worldmap_barplots/` directory.
